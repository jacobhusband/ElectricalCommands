I have a C# .NET 8 project that is shared in a GitHub repository. The project is structured as follows:

Main Project: ElectricalCommands.csproj - A packaging project that references all command modules to bundle them together.
Modules:
CleanCADCommands: Provides commands for cleaning CAD drawings, such as embedding images from XREFs/PDFs, cleaning title blocks, and overall sheet cleanup.
GeneralCommands: General utility commands like creating wipeouts, viewports from regions, and padded outlines around blocks.
T24Commands: Specialized commands for inserting images/PDFs, calculating areas, and summing text values.
TextCommands: Commands for manipulating text content, including replacing, incrementing, and adding values.
PlotCommands: Commands for plotting layouts to PDF at various sizes (e.g., 30x42, 24x36).
GetAttributesCommands: Commands for extracting attributes from lines and text objects.
When I build the project using dotnet build ElectricalCommands.sln -c Release, it creates .DLL files which I load into AutoCAD to use custom command methods.

My application has this issue:


I want to fix it by updating the following:
